# OOP-Ferrofluid-Composition-formula
A small program for my dissertation that uses basic OOP to calculate weights/volumes of ingredients.

I created this as an ease of use and time saver when it came to the calculations of the ingrediants needed to create my desired ferrofluid
It is not yet complete as there are unit calculation errors and will be updated with a better structured code soon
